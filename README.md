## Added features
There are six ships on the board that are randomly allocated. The algorithms tries to place a ship at a random place on the board, while checking for the following constraints:
1. A ship must be inside the board
2. Ships cannot overlap and cannot touch each other

After the suitable place is found, the ship is added to the board.
